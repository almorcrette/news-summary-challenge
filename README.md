# News Summary JavaScript Frontend Web App

This is a small news summary app, built to demonstrate my JavaScript frontend web app skills. It is my solution to Makers Academy's week 7 weekend challenge.

I've created an app that shows the latest news using the Guardian API.

My app grabs all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and displays them on a
page. Clicking on a headline will link the user to the actual article page on the Guardian's website.

It's a single page web app, written in frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/almorcrette/news-summary-challenge.git`

TBC
`command_to_install_dependencies` (e.g. `bundle`)

## Usage

TBC

`command_to_start` (e.g. `rackup` or `rails s`)
Navigate to `http://localhost:4567/`


## Running tests

TBC
`test_command` (e.g. `rspec`)

## File manifest

----------------------------------------------

At the barest minimum, it should contain a description of what the code does, how to install it, how to use it and how to run its tests. In addition, READMEs often include other information such as:

- Configuration instructions
- A file manifest (list of files included)
- Copyright and licensing information
- Contact information for the distributor or programmer
- Known bugs
- Troubleshooting
- Credits and acknowledgments
- A changelog (usually for programmers)
- A news section (usually for users)
